## 15-Hours-Data 

In this preliminary trial, I collected data from the MPU-9250 for 15 hours while it remained stationary on a desk. The desk surface was not level. The purpose of this trial was to see how much the mean of the data osciallted over a very long period. This data was not actually used in my thesis, but it's still interesting to see the histogram plots created.
